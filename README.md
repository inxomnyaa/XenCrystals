# XenCrystals
Warp API for WarpUI
## Why the name?
In the game Half Life, teleportation utilizes `Xen Crystals` to create teleports.

Since i sometimes write XenialDan short as `Xen`, and the `Xen` dimension is the prettiest thing i have seen in games until now, i was searching for a HL Teleportation related name. See https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Teleportation
